🤖 AI Resume Analyzer + Job Match SystemA powerful NLP-based tool designed to help job seekers optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS).📖 Project OverviewThis project is an advanced Resume Analyzer that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse resumes and compare them against specific job descriptions (JD). It provides users with a match percentage, identifies missing skills, and offers actionable keyword suggestions to increase the chances of getting shortlisted.Project Status: 🚧 In Development🚀 Key Features📄 Resume Parsing: Extracts text and specific details from PDF/DOCX resumes.🎯 Job Description Matching: Compares the resume content against a provided Job Description using vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF or Cosine Similarity).📊 ATS Score: Calculates a compatibility score (0-100%) to indicate how well the resume fits the role.🔍 Skill Gap Analysis: Identifies critical skills mentioned in the JD that are missing from the resume.💡 Improvement Suggestions: Recommends specific keywords to add.🛠️ Tech StackLanguage: Python 3.xBackend Framework: FlaskNLP/AI: NLTK, Spacy, Scikit-learn (for text processing and similarity scoring)Frontend: React.js (Optional) or HTML/CSS/Jinja2 templatesPDF Processing: PyPDF2 or pdfminer🔄 Project Flow (How it Works)The system operates in the following sequential steps:Input: The user uploads their Resume (PDF/Doc) and pastes the text of the Job Description they are targeting.Text Extraction: The backend extracts raw text from the uploaded file and cleans it (removing special characters, stop words, etc.).Tokenization & NLP: Both the Resume and the JD are tokenized. The system identifies Named Entities (Skills, Experience, Education).Matching Algorithm: The system converts text to vectors and calculates the mathematical similarity between the Resume vector and the JD vector.Analysis: The difference between the two sets of keywords is analyzed to find "Missing Skills."Output: The user is presented with a Dashboard showing their Score, Match Analysis, and Recommendations.👥 Team Members & RolesPlease update the table below with your specific team details.NameRoleResponsibilities[Krishna Sharma - Leader]Team Lead / BackendRepo management, Flask API setup, System Architecture integration.[Shivam Shukla]AI/ML EngineerDeveloping the Resume Parsing logic, NLTK/Spacy implementation, and Scoring algorithm.[Pratyush Raghuvanshi]Frontend DevUI/UX Design, creating the file upload interface and results dashboard.[Vansh Bhardwaj]Documentation/QATesting the system with real resumes, bug fixing, and maintaining documentation.💻 Installation & SetupTo work on this project, please follow the Fork & Clone workflow:1.
